            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi! My name is Zayda Kodua. I have been deeply passionate about the integration of biotechnology and data science in the medical field for several years. My interest lies particularly in how biostatisticians use data to advance medical research and improve healthcare outcomes. The combination of biology and technology opens new doors to understanding complex health issues and finding innovative solutions. With the rapid growth of data in healthcare, the ability to collect, analyze, and interpret this information has become essential in making informed medical decisions.Biostatisticians play a critical role in this process, using data to uncover trends, measure the effectiveness of treatments, and even predict disease outbreaks. This use of data is pivotal in developing new drugs, understanding genetic predispositions to certain illnesses, and optimizing patient care. For example, clinical trials rely heavily on biostatisticians to ensure that the data collected is accurately analyzed, leading to safer and more effective therapies. As technology continues to evolve, I am fascinated by how it is reshaping the biotech landscape, from personalized medicine based on genetic data to advanced predictive models in public health. My goal is to be a part of this revolution, using data science to help solve some of the most pressing medical challenges of our time.</p>
